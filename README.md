# Assembler
Assembler Project


This program uses a custom built and tested Stack, and Queue container.  The program is provided with a properly parenthesized
infix expression and converts the expression to postfix.  Then the expression is converted to Assembly.  The output is 
decided at the command line depending on if the user provided an output file or not.  If no output file is provided from the
command line then the output is printed to console.  Output consists of the infix expression postfix expression and expression with assembly instructions.
